## Overview
This project is developed with ASP.NET Core 8.0, utilizing modern technologies and a microservices architecture. With Docker integration, it offers a portable, secure, and scalable infrastructure. The project is configured to work seamlessly with both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MSSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Features

âšª Microservices Architecture: Built using Layered and Onion architectures, providing a flexible and extensible structure adhering to SOLID principles.
âšª Design Patterns: Repository, CQRS, and Mediator design patterns enhance scalability and modularity.
âšª Security: Identity Server and JWT provide user authentication and authorization.
âšª Database Management: Optimized data handling with MSSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
âšª API Management: Ocelot Gateway handles API routing, with documentation generated via Swagger.
âšª Real-Time Notifications: SignalR integration enables real-time notifications without page refreshes.
âšª Testing: API endpoints are tested and verified with Postman.

## Technologies Used
